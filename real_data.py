"""Real data bridge for the Red Hawk dashboard.

Drives the actual backend pipeline — generate_attack (YAML library) -> fire_at_target
(live target bot) -> Yanshi's 4-dimension judge — across several rounds, then emits
records in the exact shape dashboard.py consumes (Path A: one record per attack,
tagged with round + attack_family).

Two entry points:
  build_results(...)        run the live pipeline and write run_results.json
  generate_real_results()   load run_results.json for the dashboard (raises if absent)

Run the live build directly (target bot must be up on :5001):
